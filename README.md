# Patch-Clamp-sim-with-Optogenetics-integrations-
Computational patch-clamp simulation demonstrating membrane potential dynamics, excitatory/inhibitory synaptic currents, and optogenetic perturbations (ChR2 &amp; Arch/NpHR). 
# Patch-Clamp & Optogenetic Simulation

## Overview
This repository demonstrates **patch-clamp electrophysiology simulations** combined with **optogenetic perturbations** in a single neuron model. It shows understanding of:

- Electrophysiological principles: membrane potential, synaptic currents, excitatory/inhibitory balance.
- Optogenetics: light-activated ion channels (ChR2 for excitation, Arch/NpHR for inhibition).
- Chemogenetics (conceptual): can be added as modulatory conductances mimicking designer receptors.

## Method Literacy

### Dry Lab (Computational)
- Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neuron model simulates membrane potential dynamics.
- Conductance-based synapses model **AMPA (excitatory) and GABA (inhibitory)** currents.
- Optogenetic perturbations simulate **light-activated changes in excitability**.

### Wet Lab (Experimental)
- Mirrors real patch-clamp recordings of neurons in vitro/in vivo.
- Optogenetic pulses correspond to **stimulation of genetically defined neuron subpopulations**.
- Can be extended to **chemogenetic modulation**, fiber photometry, or Ca²⁺ imaging.

## Transfer to Labonté Lab Projects
- **Inhibitory control of cortical circuits:** GABAergic subpopulations can be simulated with Arch/NpHR perturbations.  
- **Emotionally driven and motivated behaviors:** Modulate pyramidal neuron firing with ChR2 pulses.  
- **Intersectional viral strategies:** Targeted optogenetic conductances mimic selective subpopulation activation.  
- **Stress-related behavior studies:** Adjust baseline E/I balance or conductances to simulate chronic stress effects.
